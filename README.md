# BEARVIM

Bearvim is a bare minimum neovim config to get started on
using neovim for beginners and also for advanced users.
I tried many neovim distributions overtime but i always
came back to my personal configs, mostly because most of the
neovim distributions are complicated and they seem to make
everything way overboard.  
This config aims to bridge the gap. This i a little bit
opinianated but it offers a lot of flexibility in terms of
adapting it to your own liking.

_NB: This is solely a neovim config. It probably will not work
with vanilla vim._
